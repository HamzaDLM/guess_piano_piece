## Motivation
Aspiring to become a decent classical pianist, I created this website to help me test my knowledge in recognizing famous classical piano pieces in a fun way.
## Want to Help?
Being mostly a backend developer, I would love to hear your opinion and critics about the website, especially UI/UX wise. 
## Disclaimer
I do not own the recordings played in this website, if you are the owner and you wish to have them removed, please contact me and I will do so as soon as possible.
