## Motivation
Aspiring to become a decent classical pianist, I created this website to help me test my knowledge in recognizing famous classical piano pieces in a fun way.
## Info
To avoid getting the answer through looking at the audio file name through the developer console, the file's names have been hashed using sha1 (10 characters used). The files still belong to the original owner Bernd Krueger.
## Want to Help?
Being mostly a backend developer, I would love to hear your opinion and critics about the website, especially UI/UX wise. If you have enhancements to propose, feel free to make a pull request!
